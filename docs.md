This project was created for the FreeScape IIIT Kalyani club for the Introduction to Python event.  
  
The reader can utilise the articles and/or github links we've supplied as resources to further explore this widely used project.  
  
For this project, we'll be combining [Python Discord module](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) with [speech recognition](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/) library and [pyttsx3](https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx3/).  

## Features as a bot:
1. To reply to the user whenever called to do so.  
2. To make the long typing tasks easier.   
3. To give the answers asked by the user in discord itself.  
4. To speak the message recieved for the deaf people.  
5. To send Images and GIF's.  
6. To play some interesting games.
