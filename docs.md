# PyNova-Discord Bot 

This project was created forÂ the FreeScape IIIT Kalyani club for the Introduction to Python event.  
  
The reader can utilise the articles and/or github links we've supplied as resources to further explore this widely used project.  
  
For this project, we'll be combining [Python Discord module](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) with [speech recognition](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/) library andÂ [pyttsx3](https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx3/).  

## Features as a bot:
1. To reply to the user whenever called to do so.  
2. To make the long typing tasks easier.   
3. To give the answers asked by the user in discord itself.  
4. To speak the message recieved for the deaf people.  
5. To send Images and GIF's.  
6. To play some interesting games.  

## What's new? ðŸ¤” 
1. This bot uses the basics of the Natural Language Processing and delivers it as a message. 
2. It uses the [ChatGPT API](https://openai.com/api/) to answer all your questions. 
3. Also serves as an entertainment purpose through a game. (Just like Dank Memer)
